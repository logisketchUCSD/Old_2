1) Documentation and Results: Outline of what CircuitRec does, as well as old results of the CircuitRec before the changes to the endpoint algorithm (making it work for more than two endpoints per wire) were made.

2) NN Test Files: XML test files used to test the neural net (different from the training files used to train the neural net)

3) Training Data 17: Training data used for the 17 feature neural net (not being used)

4) Training Data 13: Training data used for the 13 feature neural net

5) fulltrain 462_17.bp: File describing the 17 feature neural net.
