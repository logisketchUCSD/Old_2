These are serialized Designations for and, or, not, nand, nor, xor, xnor gates.
The training data was the Trunk\Data\E85\Old Labeled Documents folder.
They should be put in the same folder as Congeal.dll, wherever that may be 
(but don't add them to subversion there, you goof!).

They don't work very well, ~1/6 or so.
